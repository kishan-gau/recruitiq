// This file is a placeholder for future shared Payroll components
// As components are identified that are used across multiple Payroll features,
// they should be moved to this directory and re-exported here.

// Example structure (to be populated):
// export { CurrencySelector } from './CurrencySelector';
// export { PaymentMethodSelector } from './PaymentMethodSelector';
// export { PayslipStatusBadge } from './PayslipStatusBadge';
// export { PayrollPeriodSelector } from './PayrollPeriodSelector';
// export { SalaryComponentBreakdown } from './SalaryComponentBreakdown';
