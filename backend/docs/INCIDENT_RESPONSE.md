## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis

#### Detection Sources

1. **Automated Monitoring**
   - Security monitoring alerts (SecurityMonitor service)
   - CloudWatch alarms
   - Datadog alerts
   - Log analysis tools
   - Intrusion detection systems

2. **Manual Detection**
   - User reports
   - Security audit findings
   - Penetration test results
   - Threat intelligence

#### Initial Analysis

When an incident is detected:

1. **Acknowledge the alert** (within SLA timeframe)
   ```bash
   # Log incident detection
   POST /api/security/incidents
   {
     "severity": "P1",
     "type": "data_breach",
     "description": "Suspicious data export detected",
     "detectedBy": "security_monitor"
   }
   ```

2. **Gather initial information**
   - What happened?
   - When did it happen?
   - What systems are affected?
   - Is the threat still active?
   - What is the potential impact?

3. **Classify the incident**
   - Determine severity (P0-P4)
   - Identify incident type
   - Assess potential data exposure

4. **Activate response team**
   - Notify Incident Commander
   - Assemble appropriate team members
   - Establish communication channel (Slack, Teams)

### Phase 2: Containment

#### Short-term Containment

**Goal**: Stop the immediate threat while preserving evidence

**Actions**:
1. **Isolate affected systems**
   ```bash
   # Disable compromised user account
   UPDATE users SET is_active = false WHERE id = <user_id>;
   
   # Block malicious IP addresses
   # Add to firewall rules or WAF
   ```

2. **Preserve evidence**
   ```bash
   # Copy logs before they rotate
   cp /var/log/app.log /security/incidents/<incident_id>/
   
   # Database snapshot
   pg_dump recruitiq_prod > /security/incidents/<incident_id>/db_snapshot.sql
   ```

3. **Stop the attack**
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Block malicious traffic
   - Disable vulnerable services
   - Disconnect affected systems from network

#### Long-term Containment

**Goal**: Implement temporary fixes while maintaining business operations

**Actions**:
1. **Apply temporary patches**
2. **Implement additional monitoring**
3. **Deploy workarounds**
4. **Strengthen access controls**

### Phase 3: Eradication

**Goal**: Completely remove the threat and fix vulnerabilities

**Actions**:
1. **Identify root cause**
   ```bash
   # Analyze logs for initial compromise
   grep -r "suspicious_pattern" /var/log/
   
   # Review security events
   SELECT * FROM security_events 
   WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '<start>' AND '<end>'
   ORDER BY timestamp;
   ```

2. **Remove malware/backdoors**
   - Run malware scans
   - Review code for backdoors
   - Check cron jobs and startup scripts
   - Verify system file integrity

3. **Patch vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   # Update vulnerable dependencies
   npm audit fix
   
   # Apply security patches
   git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch
   # Make fixes
   git commit -m "fix: Security patch for CVE-XXXX"
   ```

4. **Strengthen security**
   - Update firewall rules
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Improve logging
   - Update security policies

### Phase 4: Recovery

**Goal**: Restore systems to normal operation

**Actions**:
1. **Restore from clean backups** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Restore database
   psql recruitiq_prod < /backups/clean_backup_<timestamp>.sql
   
   # Verify data integrity
   # Run integrity checks
   ```

2. **Verify system integrity**
   - Run security scans
   - Check for residual malware
   - Verify configurations
   - Test functionality

3. **Gradually restore services**
   - Start with non-critical services
   - Monitor for anomalies
   - Progressively restore critical services
   - Implement enhanced monitoring

4. **Password resets** (if credentials compromised)
   ```bash
   # Force password reset for all users
   UPDATE users SET password_reset_required = true;
   
   # Invalidate all sessions
   DELETE FROM sessions;
   ```

### Phase 5: Post-Incident Activities

**Goal**: Learn from the incident and improve defenses

**Actions**:
1. **Conduct post-incident review**
2. **Document lessons learned**
3. **Update security controls**
4. **Improve detection capabilities**
5. **Update incident response plan**
